                You <b>must</b> arrive at least 10 minutes before your
                assigned time. Bring your <b>ID</b>. If you cannot
                attend during your time slot, it is <b>your

                The <b>oral exam</b> will test your understanding of
                the material, the ideas and concepts. You will not be
                required to perform complicated calculations. It will
                often require you to explain how you solved various
                problems in the homework assignments or in the written
                part of the exam. <u>If it is clear that you do not
                  understand, you might receive a negative grade</u>.
                The oral exam will last between 20-30 minutes.<br>
                <br>
                After the exam I will tell you if you have passed or
                failed. If you have passed, I will tell you your grade.
                Grading will follow the grading guidelines (see below).
                If you are happy with your grade, you will sign your
                name to confirm. This will determine your grade, and it
                cannot be altered. Only in exceptional circumstances it
                will be allowed to try to improve a grade in the next
                call. You may refuse the grade and try to retake the
                exam at a later call. If you fail, you can attend the
                next call. In either case, you will be allowed to take
                your written exam paper with you. To do this, you will
                have to sign and declare that you have taken the exam
                (and will not have any future objections to the grade
                you received).<br>
