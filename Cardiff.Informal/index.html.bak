Lieb-Thirring inequalities give              estimates on the discrete eigenvalues and their accumulation rate              to the essential spectrum. Such information is useful in quantum              mechanics, but the estimates are well understood only in the              self-adjoint setting. In the second part of the talk I will              present recent results concerning possible extensions of the              Lieb-Thirring inequalities to the non-self-adjoint setting (based              on joint work with Frantisek Stampach).<br />              <br />            </p>          </blockquote>        </ul>        <p><span class="style4"><span class="style3">May 29:</span> Marco            Marletta (Cardiff)</span> <span class="style4"> - A Laplace            operator with boundary conditions singular at one point</span> </p>        <ul>          <blockquote>            <p>In this talk I will present some work with Rozenblum from 2009.              While it has been known for more than half a century that the              Laplace operator on a smooth, bounded domain may have essential              spectrum if the boundary conditions are suitably chosen, typical              choices involved non-local operators. In this talk I will show,              with very elementary arguments, that even local boundary              conditions, singular even just at a single point - can have a huge              impact on the spectrum and eigenfunctions. The example we              consider, first proposed by Berry and Dennis. still has empty              essential spectrum and compact resolvent. However Weyl’s law fails              completely because the spectrum becomes unbounded below. The              positive eigenvalues still obey Weyl asymptotics, to leading              order; however the (absolute values of the) negative eigenvalues              do not obey a power law distribution.<br />              <br />            </p>          </blockquote>        </ul>        <p><span class="style4"><span class="style3">June 5:</span> Ian Wood            (Kent) - Introduction to Dirichlet to Neumann maps and boundary            triples</span> </p>        <ul>          <blockquote>            <p>Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps play an important role in the analysis              of many boundary problems for partial differential equations, in              particular inverse problems and interface problems.

We will then introduce the abstract              framework of boundary triples, where an analogue of the              Dirichlet-to-Neumann map, the M-function, can be introduced, and              look at the question of how much spectral information the              M-function contains.<br />              <br />            </p>          </blockquote>        </ul>        <p><span class="style4"><span class="style3">June 12:</span> Jean Lagacé            (UCL)</span> <span class="style4"> - Homogenisation in geometric            spectral theory --- a quick introduction</span> </p>        <ul>          <blockquote>            <p>In this talk, I will describe an homogenisation construction for              the Steklov problem on manifolds. While we do not assume that              there is a periodic structure, the construction is nevertheless              deterministic. I will make explicit what is different from the              usual periodic setting, and what we can learn even in the periodic              setting from this construction. The audience of this talk will not              be supposed to be familiar with either homogenisation theory nor              the Steklov problem. With time permitting, I will also discuss              some applications to differential geometry. The talk is based on              joint work with Alexandre Girouard, Antoine Henrot, and Mikhail              Karpukhin.<br />              <br />            </p>          </blockquote>        </ul>        <p><span class="style4"><span class="style3">June 26:</span> Laura Monk            (Strasbourg)</span> <span class="style4"> - Geometry and spectrum            of random hyperbolic surfaces</span> </p>        <ul>          <blockquote>            <p>In this talk, I will explain:</p>            <ul>              <li>how one can consider and study random hyperbolic surfaces,</li>              <li>the geometry of typical random surfaces: their diameter,                Cheeger constant, ...,</li>              <li>how to deduce from the geometry of a hyperbolic surface                information about the spectrum of the Laplacian.</li>            </ul>          </blockquote>        </ul>        <p> </p>        <p> </p>        <p>  </p>        <p> </p>        <p> </p>      </div>    </div>    <div id="footer"> </div>  </body></html>
