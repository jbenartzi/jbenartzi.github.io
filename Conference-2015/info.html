    <p>The conference will be held at the <strong>South Kensington Campus</strong>, located in central London. The <a href="http://www.imperial.ac.uk/natural-sciences/departments/mathematics/">Department of Mathematics</a> is located at the Huxley Building, 180 Queen's Gate, London, SW7 2AZ.</p>
    <p>The nearest tube lines are the Piccadilly and District lines. The Piccadilly line extends to Heathrow Airport in the west, and to King's Cross Train Station in the east (this is where Eurostar trains arrive from Paris and Brussels).</p>
    <p>All talks will take place on the first floor of the building, at room 144. The mathematics department is located on the 6th floor, and the mathematics common room (this is where you can get coffee) is located on the 5th floor.</p>
