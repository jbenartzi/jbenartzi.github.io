<h2>Abstracts</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify">Carlo <strong>Mercuri</strong> (Swansea) - Quantitative symmetry breaking of groundstates for a class of weighted Emden-Fowler equations</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Joint work with Ederson Moreira Dos Santos.</p>
  <p>We prove that symmetry breaking occurs in dimensions N\geq 3 for the  groundstate solutions to a class of Emden-Fowler equations  on the unit ball, with Dirichlet boundary condition. We highlight this  phenomenon considering large values of a certain exponent for a radial  weight function appearing in the equation, which is reminiscent of the  classical Hénon equation. The particular weight  function we consider possesses a spherical shell of zeroes centred at  the origin and of radius R. A quantitative condition on R for this  symmetry breaking phenomenon to occur is given by means of universal  constants, such as the best constant for the subcritical  Sobolev embedding. Moreover, combining energy estimates and Liouville  type theorems we study some qualitative and quantitative properties of  the groundstate solutions.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Baptiste <strong>Morisse</strong> (Cardiff) - The onset of instabilities for non hyperbolic systems</p>
<blockquote>
  <p style="text-align:justify">We consider systems of first-order, quasilinear PDEs. In the case of  (strongly) hyperbolic systems, it is well-know that the system is  well-posed in Sobolev spaces. We study here the cases where  hyperbolicity fails – that is, the spectrum of the symbol of the  operator is non real. We disprove the Holder-type estimate of the  propagator, even in Gevrey regularity, by constructing families of  analytical solutions which present the typical growth in time and  frequency linked to the particular failure of hyperbolicity we deal  with. The talk is aimed to be self-contained and concise in order for  everyoneto follow.</p>

</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify">Andrew <strong>Neate</strong> (Swansea) - Semiclassical diffusions</p>
<blockquote>
  <p style="text-align:justify">We  consider some examples of diffusion process associated with the  semiclassical limits of coherent states for the harmonic  oscillator and Coulomb potentials. The drifts in these diffusions can  be viewed as arising from constrained Hamiltonian systems with complex  valued Hamiltonians. The corresponding classical systems have periodic  solutions, and by approximating our processes  with appropriate asymptotic series, we can consider them as examples of  random periodic processes.</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify">Junyong <strong>Zhang</strong> (Cardiff) - Strichartz estimate and Schrödinger operator in a conic singular space</p>
<blockquote>
  <p style="text-align:justify"> In this talk, we will discuss a Schrodinger operator in a conic  singular space and the Strichartz estimate for the dispersive equation  associated with this operator. The main techniques are the microlocal  analysis method and spectral analysis argument. This is a joint work  with Jiqiang Zheng (Institute of Applied Physics and Computational  Mathematics, China).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Chandrasekhar <strong>Venkataraman</strong> (Sussex) - Multiscale modelling of biological problems</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Problems  involving multiple scales are ubiquitous in biology and their modelling  presents a number of mathematical and computational  challenges.  In this talk we discuss two such problems. <u></u><br>
    <br>
    In  the first part of the talk, we consider problems from theoretical  ecology for the dynamics of two competing species that reside  in a heterogeneous environment. In particular, we wish to understand  the role played by heterogeneous motility on invasion behaviour in  mathematical models for competition between motile species. We study the  effect of rapidly oscillating periodic motilities  while performing simultaneous homogenization and strong competition  limits. The limit problem is shown to be a free boundary problem of  Stefan type with effective coefficients. We will also discuss the  implications our analysis has on invasiveness of a species.  The results will be supported by numerical simulations.<u></u><br>
    <br>
    In  the second part of the talk, we consider the derivation, analysis and  simulation of mathematical models for cellular signalling  processes in biological tissues. A coupled system of nonlinear  bulk-surface partial differential equations is used to model the  dynamics of signalling molecules in the inter- and intra-cellular spaces  as well as for the cell membrane resident receptors. Using  multiscale analysis techniques, we derive a macroscopic two-scale model  for signalling processes defined on the tissue level. A two-scale  numerical method is developed and implemented for simulations of the  macroscopic bulk-surface problem and numerical results  will be presented illustrating the role cell scale heterogeneities play  in the dynamics of macroscopic concentrations.</p>
