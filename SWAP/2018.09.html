<h2>Abstracts</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify">Marco <strong>Marletta</strong> (Cardiff) - Inverse problems for Maxwell systems with partial boundary data</p>
<blockquote>
  <p style="text-align:justify">We prove that the coefficients in the time-harmonic Maxwell system are uniquely determined by measurements of
 the tangential components of the electric and magnetic fields on any (arbitrarily small) open subset of the boundary. The
 proof is based on a generalisation of the Alessandrini identity, due to Lassas, Salo and Uhlmann, and on a Runge principle
 for the Maxwell system and the related Schrodinger operator with matrix-valued potential.

 This is joint work with Malcolm Brown and Juan Manuel Reyes Gonzales, funded by EPSRC grant EP/K024078/1.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Jiang-Lun <strong>Wu</strong> (Swansea) - BMO and Morrey-Campanato estimates for stochastic singular integral operators and their applications to parabolic SPDEs</p>
<blockquote>
  <p style="text-align:justify">Stochastic integral operators defined in the stochastic integral of convolution manner appeared naturally in the mild formulation of SPDEs. In this talk, we derive BMO and Morrey-Campanato estimates for stochastic singular integral operators, We then apply our results to discuss various estimates (including the Schauder estimates)  of the solutions of SPDEs with additive noises. Joint work with Guangying Lv, Hongjun Gao and Jinlong Wei.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Federica <strong>Dragoni</strong> (Cardiff) - Geometrical properties for solutions of subelliptic nonlinear PDEs</p>
<blockquote>
  <p style="text-align:justify">Geometrical properties for solutions to elliptic and parabolic PDEs is a classic mathematical problem. In particular we will focus on starshapedness, a geomet- rical notion deeply connected to convexity but weaker than that. For elliptic PDEs it is know that the capacitary potential defined on a starshaped ring has starshaped level sets. We generalise this results in the setting of subelliptic PDEs, in particular to PDEs associated to Carnot groups. Carnot groups are non-commutative nilpotent Lie groups which are not isomorphic to R^N at any scale. Going into these more degenerate geometries some unexpected phenom- ena appear: e.g. there are different possible notions of starshapedness and they may not be all equivalent. We use a notion associated to the the natural scaling in Carnot groups (dilations) and show that this geometrical property is inher- ited by the level sets of a large class of nonlinear PDEs. Joint work with Nicola Garofalo and Paolo Salani.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Peter <strong>Hintz</strong> (Berkeley) - Stability of black holes</p>
<blockquote>
  <p style="text-align:justify">More than a hundred years ago, Schwarzschild first wrote down the mathematical description of a black hole; on a technical level, black holes are certain types of solutions of Einstein's equations of general relativity. While they have since become part of popular culture, many fundamental questions about them remain unanswered: for example, it is not yet known mathematically if they are stable! I will explain what that means and outline a recent proof of full nonlinear stability (obtained in joint work with A. Vasy) in the case that the cosmological constant is positive, a condition consistent with current cosmological models of the universe. The talk is intended as a non-technical introduction to the subject, with a focus on the central role played by modern microlocal and spectral theoretical techniques.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Dmitri <strong>Finkelshtein</strong> (Swansea) - Long-time behavior for monostable (doubly) nonlocal reaction-diffusion equations</p>
<blockquote>
  <p style="text-align:justify">We consider a class of monostable  equations in R^d with nonlocal diffusion and local or nonlocal  reaction, which satisfy the linear determinacy principle.  For the case where either the diffusion kernel or the initial condition  have appropriately regular heavy tails, we find sharp estimates to  describe accelerated front propagation. For the one-dimensional case we  show also that the propagation to the right direction  is fullydetermined  by the right tails of either the kernel or the initial condition. We  describe both cases of integrable and  monotone-like initial conditions which may yield different rates of the  acceleration. For the case where (anisotropic multidimensional) kernel  is decaying at least exponentially fast in a direction and if the  initial condition has the similar property, we  show that the solution propagates in this direction at most linearly in  time. For a particular equation arising in population ecology, we study  then traveling waves and describe the front of propagation. This is a joint work with Pasha Tkachov (GSSI, L&rsquo;Aquila).  <p style="text-align:justify">
